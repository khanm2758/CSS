            <h2>Australian pelican</h2>
            <p><h4>Appearance:</h4> Australian pelicans are known for their long, pale pink bill, which is the longest of any bird. They have white plumage with black wings and a greyish neck</p>
            <p><h4>Habitat: </h4>These pelicans are found in inland and coastal waters of Australia and New Guinea, as well as in Fiji, parts of Indonesia, and occasionally as vagrants in New Zealand</p>
            <p><h4>Diet:</h4> They primarily feed on fish, which they catch by using their bill as a scoop. They are also known for their cooperative feeding behavior, where groups of pelicans work together to herd fish into shallow waters for easier capture</p>
            <p><h4>Size:</h4> Australian pelicans are large birds, with a wingspan that can reach up to 2.5 meters (8.2 feet)</p>
            <p><h4>Behavior:</h4> They are social birds and often seen in groups, especially during feeding</p>
